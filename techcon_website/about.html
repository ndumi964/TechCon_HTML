            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <img src="images/techcon-history.jpg" alt="TechCon founders at the first conference in 2010" width="600">
            <p>TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of 200 technology enthusiasts in San Francisco. What started as a local meetup has grown into one of the world's premier tech conferences, hosting over 10,000 attendees annually. Over the past 14 years, we've expanded to include satellite events in London, Tokyo, and Sydney.</p>
            <p>Key milestones include our first international conference in 2015, the introduction of our student scholarship program in 2018, and our first fully virtual conference in 2020 that reached attendees in 142 countries.</p>

            <p>TechCon exists to bridge the gap between emerging technologies and practical implementation. Our mission is threefold:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To educate and inspire the next generation of technologists</li>
                <li>To foster meaningful connections across disciplines and industries</li>
                <li>To showcase innovations that solve real-world problems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe technology should be accessible, ethical, and human-centered. Each year, we curate our program to reflect these values while pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
